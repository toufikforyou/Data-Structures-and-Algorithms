## Languages Used

This repository contains implementations in the following programming languages:

- Python
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- Go
- C

Feel free to contribute additional implementations in your preferred language!

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/{toufikforyou}/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the specific data structure or algorithm implementation.

3. Run or test the code according to the language-specific instructions.

   For example:
   - For Python, run: `python algorithm_name.py`
   - For Java, compile and run using `javac` and `java`.
   - For C/C++, use `gcc` or `g++` to compile and run.

4. For each algorithm or data structure, you can find a usage example and description in the respective file.
